# Processing-IMDb
Extreme Computing Assignments

## Assignment 1: using Scala collection
This assignment will be on processing the IMDB dataset – we have chosen a subset for these tasks to encourage you to think about how to structure your solutions to use multiple input data collections, and
efficiently process structured text using Scala collections.

## Assignment 2: using Apache Spark
This assignment will also be on processing the IMDB dataset. However, this time you need to use Apache Spark to efficiently process structured text. Note that you are only allowed to use Spark RDDs (e.g., map,
groupBy, join). This means that you are NOT allowed to use other facilities provided by the Spark ecosystem including Spark SQL.
